Authors -Suraj Sudhakar, Ganavi Basavaraju, Keerthana Krishnamurthy Burly

This project is conducted on behalf of course project of Neural Networks: Theory & Implementation at Saarland University.
The Repository contain's the the speech data files, code/ notebooks for the task prediction, the report and the final presentation.

* Evaluated and compared various models (linear, CNN, RNN, LSTM, Temporal 1D CNN) for Spoken Digit Recognition.
* Investigated the impact of data shortage on model performance and assessed the effectiveness of data augmentation.
* Achieved a notable 64.81% accuracy on test data with the Temporal 1D CNN model, outperforming Baseline- SGD (54.67%) and LSTM (57.85%).
* Conducted self-supervised contrastive learning experiment on the unlabeled dataset: Impressive accuracy of 84.38% was achieved using SimCLR.
